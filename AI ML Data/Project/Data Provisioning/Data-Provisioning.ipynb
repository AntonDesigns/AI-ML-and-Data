This validated my success category definitions as meaningful. However, high variance explains why prediction is challenging budget alone isn't sufficient. Notable patterns: low-budget hits exist (under $20M budget, over $100M revenue), and expensive flops cluster in $100-200M budget range, suggesting diminishing returns at extreme budgets. This confirmed budget_log as essential feature but showed I need additional features (ratings, timing) to explain the variance."

    "Testing multiple algorithms revealed k-NN was optimal for this dataset. \n",
    "- - The comparison shows distance-based learning (k-NN finding similar movies) works better than tree ensembles (RF), linear models (Logistic), or kernel methods (SVM). \n",
    "- - This makes intuitive sense - if 20 similar movies with same budget range, runtime, and ratings were Hits, the new movie will likely be a Hit too. \n",

    " - - Break-even has worst performance (F1=0.26) because these movies have ambiguous characteristics - they combine elements of both Flops and Hits (e.g., decent budget but barely profitable, or good ratings but low revenue). \n",
    " - - The confusion matrix shows Break-even movies get misclassified in both directions: 58 called Flops, 43 correct, 94 called Hits. Hit performs best (F1=0.59) due to class imbalance - with 447 Hit examples (50.2% of data), k-NN's 20 neighbors are more likely to find Hit neighbors, and Hits have clearer characteristics (high budget + high ratings + high revenue)."

    "- - RF builds 100 decision trees. Each tree makes splits like \"if imdb_rating > 7.0 → Hit (95% accurate), else → Flop (70% accurate)\". \n",
    "- - For each feature, RF measures: \"How much does accuracy improve when I split on this feature?\" Features that create the biggest accuracy improvements (purest groups with most Hits in one branch, most Flops in the other) get highest importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "- imdb_rating has highest importance, confirming Visualization 1's finding that it has strongest class separation (Hit 6.9 - Flop 6.3 = 0.63 points gap). \n",
    "- - vote_average is second (0.53 points gap), \n",
    "- - budget_log third (0.40 units gap), \n",
    "- - runtime lowest (only 4 minutes gap). \n",
    "\n",
    "- This validates that quality metrics (ratings) drive predictions more than production metrics (budget, runtime). Audiences care more about movie quality than how much was spent or how long it is. The feature importance rankings perfectly match the class separation metrics from Visualization 1, confirming our feature selection was correct."
